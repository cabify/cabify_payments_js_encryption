# Cabify Payments Client-Side Encryption

This library is for use with Cabify's payment gateway. It encrypts sensitive payment information in a web browser using the public key of an asymmetric key pair.

Inspired by [Braintree's Javascript Client Side library](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_client_side_encryption).
